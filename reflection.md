I did not consult any classmates nor visit any TA sessions for this assignment.

My initial impression of Java is that it is a very complicated and sometimes frustrating language. Whereas Python is simple and better at understanding the user, Java is much more strict about what you are trying to do. However, it makes up for it in that it's more memory efficient and is better at pointing out errors.

The fact that both Java and Python need their own ways to interpret the user (to a very specific point) leads me to believe that programming in general involves a lot of problem-solving, no matter what language you use. The language itself can only do so much to understand what you tell it, and the rest is up to you.

Originally I was going to make one large "response" method, containing both respondCanned and respondMirror. But this became confusing and tedious very quickly, and I realized that I could just put all that extra code into main and have shorter methods that were easier to understand. I also originally used the replaceAll() function to convert the edited response into a String object, so that all brackets and commas were replaced with nothing. But then I noticed that this removed all commas in the original response, so I had to find another method (which ended up being the String.join() method).

My advice to future students is to not be afraid to try something new in your program. I knew nothing about Java dictionaries before this project, and I didn't even know that Map objects existed. But now I have a fully functioning program that uses it and its methods, and I feel like I learned a lot.
